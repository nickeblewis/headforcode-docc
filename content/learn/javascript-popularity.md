### Why is it so popular?

If you consider the wealth of possibility that this enables, I think that goes a long way in explaining why a language like Javascript is the number one most popular language. People want to learn it and companies want to embrace it. It has led to the web becoming a huge part of our lives because it has made ideas considered impossible a decade ago totally achievable in today's technology.

JavaScript is ubiquitous across all browsers and hence all devices. One script will work across a multitude of platforms. There is no wonder it has become the success that it has.

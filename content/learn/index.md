## What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a well-defined procedure that allows a computer to solve a problem. A sequence of concise instructions based on a series of decisions.

So for example you could think of an algorithm that sorts an unordered set of people's first names alphabetically. Such as:

- Tom
- Angela
- Zach
- Jennifer
- Rupert

In other words the **problem** is that we have a small set of data which needs to arranged into an alphabetical list for display.

We now design our **algorithm** to achieve this and solve the problem. There are various ways this can be done and we shall start with a hands-on approach using javascript.

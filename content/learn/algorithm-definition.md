## Definition of an algorithm
### Input

An algorithm may not necessarily take any inputs but in the case of what we are aiming to achieve here, we will consider our list of peoples' names to be the input.

### Output

An algorithm is always going to produce at least one output and in the case of this lesson that will be whatever we provided as our input but in alphabetical order instead.

### Definiteness

All algorithms will follow a particular process as defined by the programmer, so it is important to consider all of the steps it should carry out in a clear and concise fashion.

### Finiteness

An Algorithm must always be finite, it will only carry out so many steps and when completed it's job is done.

### Correctness

Every step of the algorithm must generate correct output. If anything goes wrong during this process, perhaps when data is not being input correctly, this is the cause of most bugs!
